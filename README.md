🌿🐝 Osmia lignaria & Climate Change in California

Modeling the future of a wild solitary bee and its native plant resources

📖 Project Description

This repository hosts the code, data, and analyses for studying the effects of climate change on the wild solitary bee Osmia lignaria and its plant resources in California, as part of California’s Fifth Climate Change Assessment.

We use species distribution modeling (SDM), climate projections (LOCA2), and ecological trait data to:

Estimate current and future distributions of O. lignaria and its resource plants.

Quantify changes in climatic suitability under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP245, SSP370, SSP585).

Assess ecological risks to pollination services and biodiversity conservation.
